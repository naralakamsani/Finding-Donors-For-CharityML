# Finding Donors for CharityML

### Project Overview
* CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley
* Established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning
* Determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually
* Decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity
* The goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.
